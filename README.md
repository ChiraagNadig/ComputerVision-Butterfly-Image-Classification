# ComputerVision-Image-Classification
Classifies different digit images and butterfly images with scikit-learn, numpy

Digit images retrieved from MNIST dataset
Butterfly images retrieved from Leeds butterfly dataset

Model design:
1. Extract feature from images
2. Train classifier on features

MNIST (digit images) dataset:
- Convert raw images into 1D vector
- Learn LDA transformation from vectors

Leeds butterfly (butterfly images) dataset:
- Compute and extract key components and features from grayscale images of the butterflies
- Learn LDA transformation to extract features

Comparing 3 classifiers: Logistic Regression, Multi Layer Perceptron, and AdaBoosted Decision Trees
